Structure:


Structures are declared using the struct keyword followed by the structure name. The data members of the structure are declared within curly brackets.
Each member of a structure is stored in separate memory locations, and the structure stores each member in its own block of memory.
Structures are useful for defining a data type that contains numerous attributes of a single entity of different data types. They provide an encapsulated view of the entity they model, improving code readability 
.

Union:


Unions are declared using the union keyword followed by the union name.
Unlike structures, unions store all their members in the same memory location. This means that only one member of a union can be initialized at a time, and initializing one member will overwrite the values of other members.
Unions are useful for combining objects of different data types in the exact memory location, and they can be accessed using pointers in a similar way to structures 
.

In summary, the primary difference between a structure and a union in C is the way they store their data. While a structure stores each member in separate memory locations, a union stores all its members in the same memory location, allowing for only one member to be initialized at a time.
