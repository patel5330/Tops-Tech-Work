Q3.What is the difference between OOP and POP? 

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
*OOP treats data as a critical element in the program development and does not allow it to flow freely around
 the system.
*In OOP, the major emphasis is on data rather than procedure (function).
*It ties data more closely to the function that operate on it, and protects it from accidental modification from
 outside function.
*OOP allows decomposition of a problem into a number of entities called objects and then builds data and function
 around these objects.
*The data of an object can be accessed only by the function associated with that object. 
However, function of one object can access the function of other objects.
*C++, Java, Dot Net, Python etc are the example of Object oriented programming (OOP) language.

Features of OOP (Object Oriented Programming):-
Class
Object
Encapsulation
Data Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Data binding
Message Passing

**Procedural Oriented Programming (POP):
*In the procedure oriented approach, large programs are divided into smaller programs known as functions.
*In POP, a program is written as a sequence of procedures or function.
*In POP, each procedure (function) contains a series of instructions for performing a specific task.
*During the program execution each procedure (function) can be called by the other procedures.
*To call a procedure (function), we have to write function name only.
*While we concentrate onto the development of functions, we give very little attention to the data 
that are being used by various functions.
